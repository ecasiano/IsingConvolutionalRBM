# Convolutional RBM aided Monte Carlo: an application to the Ising Model
This Notebook is intended as an educational tool for the use of Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines in classical Montecarlo simulations. It may serve as a demonstration of the principles in [arxiv.org/abs/2008.05401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05401).

You can also directly open the Jupyter Notebook in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/danielalcalde/MCMC_CRBM/blob/master/Ising_CRBM.ipynb).
